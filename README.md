Final Project- Analyzing Politicians Tweets

In order to run our app, you must gather your own twitter credentials. Enter them into the appropriates spaces in the app.R file. Then just run the entire app.R to reproduce our shiny app.

Note, the app calls the most recent tweets, so results may vary depending on when the app is run.

Here is the link to the published app. https://ssalustri19.shinyapps.io/Analyzing_Politicians_Tweets/
