Final Project- Analyzing Politicians Tweets

In order to run our app and reproduce our results, you must gather your own twitter credentials. 
More information can be found from this website: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens.html

For convenience, we have the code for our app listed seperately in the file title 'app.R'. Enter your credentials into the appropriates spaces and then just run the entire file in order to reproduce our shiny app.

Additionally, we have a full analysis of our app, along with the code for the app itself, in the file titled 'technical_appendix.rmd". Again, be sure to include your own twitter credentials in the appropriate spaces before knitting the document. This is a necessary step as the knitted document will include the interactive app.

Lastly, here is the link to the published app in case you can't get your own credentials to work. https://ssalustri19.shinyapps.io/Analyzing_Politicians_Tweets/
